                Before Flatiron I worked for <a target= "_blank" href="http://inkdots.com/">Inkdots Printing Solutions</a> for 8 years starting as a shop hand and making it to Assistant Production Manager.
                I loved my previous job but it was time for a change so I decided in February 2021 that I would try one of my passions. Coding.
