                Before Flatiron I worked for <a target= "_blank" href="http://inkdots.com/">Inkdots Printing Solutions</a> for 8 years starting as a shop hand and making it to Assistant Production Manager.
                I loved my previous job but it was time for a change so I decided in February 2021 that I would try one of my passions. Coding.

                    Grant was a student of mine ... With his warm, compassionate smile greeting us at our daily standup Grant was an essential part of the cohort, and his natural aptitude in programming was utilized to help reinforce and support his classmates when he could.
